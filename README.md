## Vehicle Registration Number Recognition

This project implements an algorithm for automatically recognizing vehicle registration numbers in images using EasyOCR.

## Project Description

This Jupyter Notebook (VehicleRegistrationNumberRecognition.ipynb) explores techniques for extracting and recognizing vehicle registration numbers from images. The notebook likely covers aspects like:

* **Image Preprocessing:** Techniques for loading images, converting them to grayscale, and applying noise reduction and edge detection to enhance license plates.
* **License Plate Detection:** Identifying the region in the image containing the license plate using contour analysis and assuming a quadrilateral shape for the plate.
* **Character Recognition:** Utilizing EasyOCR to recognize alphanumeric characters within the extracted license plate region.
* **Result Visualization:** Displaying the original image with a bounding box around the detected license plate and the recognized text overlaid.

## Dependencies

* **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing tasks like loading, grayscale conversion, noise reduction, edge detection, and drawing bounding boxes.
* **NumPy (np):** For numerical operations used in image processing.
* **Matplotlib (plt):** Used for displaying images within the notebook (optional).
* **imutils:** A utility library for image processing tasks.
* **EasyOCR:** Open-source library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize text in images.
  
## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by creating pull requests with improvements or additional functionalities. Here are some areas for potential improvement:

* **Error handling:** Implement error handling for cases where no license plate is detected.
* **More robust license plate detection:** Explore alternative techniques for license plate detection that are less reliant on shape assumptions.
* **Character filtering and post-processing:** Implement logic to handle noise or irrelevant characters in the recognized text.
